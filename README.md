### Fake online shop made with Next.js

**SCCO.P** is a purely demonstrative project created for my portfolio to showcase the core functionality of an online product catalog. The purpose of this project is not to solve a real-world problem or feature a striking design but to highlight how the functionality of an e-commerce platform can be implemented effectively.

The project focuses on server-side rendering (SSR) using Next.js, ensuring a seamless user experience by dynamically loading product data. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, it replicates a real-world scenario where external databases are used to fetch and display product information.

Through this project, I expanded my experience across several domains, including building dynamic web applications, managing external data integration, and understanding SSR workflows.

## Technologies Used

#### React

- The core library for building the user interface, allowing dynamic and interactive components.

#### Next.js

- Utilized for server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring fast loading times and SEO-friendly pages.

#### Tailwind CSS

- A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling, which helped in building a clean and responsive design.

#### ShadCN

- A design system and component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, helping to streamline UI development with pre-designed, customizable components.

#### Supabase

- Used as a backend solution, providing a real-time database and user authentication for fetching product data from an external source.

The **SCCO.P** project allowed me to apply and expand my skills in building a dynamic web application. While the design wasnâ€™t the focus, the emphasis was on creating a functional, SSR-enabled product catalog. I gained valuable experience in integrating external databases, using Supabase for real-time data management, and implementing server-side rendering with Next.js.

Rather than upgrading this project, I plan to focus on smaller, modular projects in the future to demonstrate specific skills like shopping carts, advanced filtering, or user authentication. These smaller projects will help me build a diverse portfolio, showcasing my ability to handle different aspects of web development.
